                <br>
                
                <p class="text-space">A. I authorize Aditya Birla Health Insurance Co. Limited (Company) and their
                    authorized
                    Service Providers to debit my Bank Account directly for renewal premium of policy/application number
                    _____________</p>
                <p class="text-space">B. The max mandate limit for the E-mandate is 150% of modal premium or as mandated
                    by RBI
                    whichever is lower inclusive of Goods and Service tax. The same is taken to counter any increase in
                    premium due
                    to change in government regulations/goods and service tax rates/scheduled increase as per product
                    features or
                    change in frequency of premium payment. Rest assured that only the due premium amount will be
                    debited on the due
                    date.</p>
                <p class="text-space">C. I understand and agree that the premium amount to be debited from my account
                    may vary due
                    to change in age band if applicable, taxes and other statutory levies as may be applicable from time
                    to time and
                    authorize you to debit such changed premium from my account as may be requested by the Company even
                    if it
                    exceeds the maximum amount mentioned in the mandate.</p>
                <p class="text-space">D. I also declare that the particulars given are true, correct and complete and
                    that I may be
                    contacted by the Company to verify the below information.</p>
                <p class="text-space">E. I take full responsibility for the genuineness and correctness of the same and
                    shall inform
                    the Company of any changes there to.</p>
                <p class="text-space">F. I understand and accept that the Company shall endeavour to activate this
                    Facility within
                    30 days from the date of receipt of this mandate subject to receipt of confirmation of the above
                    details from my
                    bank and any premiums falling due during this period will need to be paid directly. In case the
                    activation does
                    not take place within 30 days of receipt of this mandate or the activation fails for any reason
                    whatsoever, I
                    shall not hold the Company responsible and I shall ensure that we pay all the renewal premiums due
                    till the date
                    of activation.</p>
                <p class="text-space">G. I understand and agree that this facility is given to me by the Company purely
                    as a service
                    gesture. I further understand and agree that though I have given this mandate, it shall be my
                    primary
                    responsibility to ensure that the premiums are received by the Company in time and I shall do all
                    such acts
                    which the Company may require us to do from time to time to ensure that this mandate works smoothly
                    and
                    effectively.</p>
                <p class="text-space">H. I understand and accept that the transaction will be effected on 5 workings
                    days before the
                    due date which shall be the preferred account hit date. In case the transaction is not completed due
                    to any
                    reason whatsoever on such day, the Company reserves its right to instruct the Bank again on 1
                    working day prior
                    to the due date for effecting the transaction. If the transaction is not completed due to any reason
                    whatsoever
                    on such day, the Company reserves its right to instruct the bank again on the due date or if due
                    date is a bank
                    holiday, on the next working day of the Bank. In the event of any failed transaction, due to any
                    reason
                    whatsoever, the charges, if any, levied by the Bank shall be borne entirely by me and I shall not
                    hold the
                    Company or the Bank responsible towards the same. The allocation and/or unitization of the premiums
                    shall be
                    based only on the date on which the amount is realized by the Company and not as on the date of
                    debit to the
                    account. If the transaction is delayed or not effected at all for incomplete or incorrect
                    information or for any
                    other reason, I shall not hold the Company or its authorized service provider responsible. I agree
                    to discharge
                    the responsibility expected of me as a participant under this scheme.</p>
                <p class="text-space">I. I understand that it shall be my sole responsibility to schedule the renewal
                    premium
                    payments in a manner that the company receives the renewal premiums within the due dates for renewal
                    of the
                    policy.</p>
                <p class="text-space">J. I also understand that the Company reserves the right to withdraw the facility
                    if one or
                    more successive payments/instructions are not received /honoured. The Company also reserves the
                    right to
                    withdraw the facility at its sole discretion at any time without giving any reason and without being
                    liable to
                    provide advance notice.</p>
                <p class="text-space">K. If I wish to revoke the below authorization, I undertake to intimate Aditya
                    Birla Health
                    Insurance Co. Limited, at least 15 days before the premium due date in writing else the same would
                    be effective
                    from the next renewal premium due date.</p>
                <p class="text-space">L. Preferred account hit date is for the purpose of premium payment only.
                    Preferred Account
                    hit date, if opted, will not alter the premium payment due dates of the policy. All policy benefits
                    would be
                    applicable as per the premium due date mentioned in the policy document. Allocation and/or
                    utilization of
                    premiums will be done at point (H) above. If the debit request is not honoured due to any reason on
                    the
                    preferred account hit date, no extension of Grace Period is allowed.</p>
